        <h1>MyGL core</h1>

<p class="desc">
Hi! I started writing a lot of JavaScript and Threejs functions. So I had a lot of different code that needed to be synchronized somehow. For this, I created mglcore - a platform for WebGL and JavaScript code. Similar to my msvcore for C++.
<p>
An important part of my library function is code structuring. At first, I started with a bunch of code. It was everywhere. Johnny, it's in the trees!
<p>
But already in version 0.3, I switched to section logic - code blocks with a clear sequence of execution.
<p>
Now, starting with version 0.8, I created a mglApp class, hiding all the complex logic in it. Now it's enough to create an instance of the class let myApp = new mglApp(); Assign the function myApp.onStartApp() to run the user code. And write myApp.onAnimateApp() for animation. Then run the application myApp.runApp(); As simple as it can be!
<p>
Hmm, could it be simpler? Maybe I'll think about how to do this in the next versions.
